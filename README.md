- You should put readme file and other files of color, layout ,... from frontend mentor
- You used colors directly a value , read more about declaration variables in ::root
- File Structure for your code is good but not perfect read more about file structure for native web apps or websites (This is best for Future projects because your project scale will grow after)
- Please in the next project don't forget type in Readme.md the best description of your project readmore about this
- In the End don't Forget These Notes for make you more perfect, but your job as a Begineer is very good 👏
